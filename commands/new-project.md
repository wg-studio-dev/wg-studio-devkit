# /new-project - Initialize New Project

Scaffolds a complete new project structure with documentation of all available commands, skills, and agents.

## What This Command Does

1. **Creates Project Structure**
   - `docs/` - Documentation directory for project files
   - `docs/transcript.md` - Template for project requirements/transcript
   - `claude.md` - Complete reference of all available commands, skills, and agents

2. **Documents All Resources**
   - Lists 40+ personal commands with descriptions and usage
   - Lists 8 personal skills with examples and usefulness
   - Lists 10+ personal agents with their specializations
   - Provides quick reference for invocation patterns

## Quick Start

To initialize a new project in your current directory:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/scripts/setup-new-project.sh "Your Project Name"
```

Or simply:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/scripts/setup-new-project.sh
```

The script will automatically create:

```
.
├── docs/
│   └── transcript.md          # Your project requirements (template)
└── claude.md                   # Complete resource reference
```

## What Gets Created

### docs/transcript.md
A template file for documenting your project vision, requirements, user flows, and success metrics. This becomes your project's single source of truth.

### claude.md

- **Commands Section** - All 40+ available slash commands with descriptions
  - Planning commands (plan, spec, build, etc.)
  - Project management (todo, execute, etc.)
  - Development tools (resolve_parallel, deploy-docs, etc.)
  - Content tools (book, yt-transcript, cc-research, etc.)
  - CRM & business tools
  - Specialized tools

- **Skills Section** - All 8 available skills with use cases
  - cc-research - Analyze r/ClaudeCode discussions
  - conversation-insights - Extract patterns from transcripts
  - email-writer - Draft professional emails
  - frontend-design - Create production-grade UIs
  - frontend-imitate - Imitate reference websites
  - frontend-inspiration - Gather design inspiration
  - gemini - Use Google Gemini API
  - monday - Integrate with Monday.com

- **Agents Section** - All 10+ specialized agents with expertise areas
  - Product agents (product-manager, product-interviewer, orchestrator)
  - Engineering agents (architect, frontend-engineer, backend-engineer)
  - Management agents (program-manager, project-manager)
  - Specialized agents (agent-cmo, call-analyzer)

- **Quick Reference** - How to invoke each resource type

## After Setup

Once your project is initialized:

1. **Edit your requirements**
   ```bash
   # Add your project vision and requirements
   edit docs/transcript.md
   ```

2. **Reference available resources**
   ```bash
   # Read the comprehensive resource guide
   cat claude.md
   ```

3. **Start with planning**
   ```bash
   /plan                    # Generate PRD and execution plan
   /spec                    # Comprehensive specification analysis
   /build                   # Build from transcript
   ```

4. **Execute with agents**
   ```bash
   /execute                 # Run your execution plan
   /todo                    # Organize tasks
   ```

## File Reference

After running `/new-project`:

- **claude.md** - Start here for a complete resource reference
- **docs/transcript.md** - Your project's single source of truth
- **docs/prd.md** - Generated by `/plan` command
- **docs/ui.md** - Generated by `/build` (frontend analysis)
- **docs/backend.md** - Generated by `/build` (backend analysis)
- **docs/todo.md** - Generated by `/plan` (execution plan)

## Tips for Success

1. **Keep docs/transcript.md updated** - It's your project's source of truth
2. **Reference claude.md frequently** - It documents all your available tools
3. **Use the right command** - Start with `/plan` for planning, `/build` for full analysis
4. **Delegate to agents** - Each agent has specific expertise (read their description in claude.md)
5. **Track progress with /todo** - Organize and execute all tasks in parallel

## Available After Setup

Once your project is created with `/new-project`, you have immediate access to:

- **40+ commands** for planning, development, and automation
- **8 skills** for specialized tasks (design, research, communication)
- **10+ agents** for delegation and expert analysis
- **Complete documentation** of all resources in claude.md

Everything is documented and ready to use. Check claude.md for the full reference!

## Next Steps

1. Run the setup script
2. Edit `docs/transcript.md` with your project vision
3. Open `claude.md` to see all available resources
4. Run `/plan` to begin your project workflow
5. Use `/execute` to start building with agent assistance
